FIXME: make check (test_stack) fails on Linux/x86 with GCC v4.6.1.
This looks to be a bug in GCC (the problem is with the inlined code of
AO_compare_double_and_swap_double_full in AO_stack_pop_acquire in PIC mode).

Add equivalent of __sync_val_compare_and_swap. Add tests.

Add C++0x ATM (atomic memory operations) layer.
