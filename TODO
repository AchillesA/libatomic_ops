FIXME: make check (test_stack) fails on Linux/x86 with GCC v4.6.1.
This either a bug in our code or in GCC. In the latter case, it might worth
to create a work-around if possible.

Add equivalent of __sync_val_compare_and_swap. Add tests.

Fix make distcheck: fails with "config.h: No such file or directory"

Remove list_atomic.c and test_atomic_include.h (as auto-generated).
Make sure they appear in the dist tarball.
