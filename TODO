TODO tasks
==========

Extract bug-fix commits from master since 7.2alpha6 and apply them
to release branch: 43ef16 (version change), d92333, 4fcfce (only for
list_atomic.template plus regenerate). "release" branch should serve for the
final release v7.2 candidate.

In master branch, set version to 7_3alpha1.

Add equivalent of __sync_val_compare_and_swap. Add tests.

Add C++0x ATM (atomic memory operations) layer.

Add a macro for designating libatomic_ops version (similar to that in BDWGC).


FIXME tasks
===========

Linux/x86 + GCC v4.6.1: make check (test_stack) fails.
This looks to be a bug in GCC (the problem is with the inlined code of
AO_compare_double_and_swap_double_full in AO_stack_pop_acquire in PIC mode).

iPhone 3GS + GCC v4.2.1 (based on Apple build 5555): test_atomic fails:
Illegal instruction.

iPhone 3GS + GCC v4.2.1: test_stack fails: Bus error.
