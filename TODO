TODO tasks
==========

Add .gitattribute file. Set crlf property. I think we should consistently
use LF across the project (including Makefile.msft) and checkout files as-is.

Drop all contents of ChangeLog in favor of Git commit annotation model.
My opinion is that ChangeLog should be updated only on offical releases and
contain only major changes.

FIXME: make check (test_stack) fails on Linux/x86 with GCC v4.6.1.
This either a bug in our code or in GCC. In the latter case, it might worth
to create a work-around if possible.

Review build process: make invokes configure unnecessarily.
Don't create autom4te.cache (or, at least, remove it on make distclean).

Add AO_and, AO_xor companions to AO_or. Add tests.

Add equivalent of __sync_val_compare_and_swap. Add tests.

Review and fix warnings displayed with -Wall -Wextra.
